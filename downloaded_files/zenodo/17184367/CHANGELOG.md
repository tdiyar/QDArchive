This is a significant update of CDC: Searchkit. It introduces thematic views, which are configurable subsets of the Data Catalogue with a specific theme. The current themes available are COORDINATE, HumMingBird and By-COVID.

The design and styling of Searchkit has been significantly updated. It now aligns closer to modern design principles and other CESSDA websites. It includes many accessibility enhancements

This release updates many of the major dependencies of Searchkit. Here are most significant changes:

- React 16 → 18
- Searchkit 2 → 4
- React Router 3 → 6
- React Redux 5 → 8

Documentation on how to add a theme can be found at [docs/collections/howto.md](docs/collections/howto.md)
